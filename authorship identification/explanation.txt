Besides the "bug feature", I came up with several features which could improve the accurancy well.

1. The length of text. I saw that the length of each line from B is seemlingly shorter than what of S on average.

2. I calculated the syllables number of every word. And I weighed them with increasing value.

3 I calculated the length of each word in a line and also weighted them with increasing value which corresponds to their location. In such way, I can better highlight differences bwtween lines from two authors.

4. I keep morphy() as a feature.

5. I used n gram on text and word_token list

6. I weighted each word in a line by calculating the position where they are(ie. how many before and after a certain word in a line)
